# Frontend Take-home

This is a React -based takehome; however, please feel free to generate an Angular, Vue, or VanillaJS application. If you choose not to use React, please provide detailed instructions on successfully running the application.

## Instructions

This exercise relies on an open-source JSON -based API, which can be found here: [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). Please build an application that makes Promise -based API requests to Swapi and retrieves more than 100 results and visualizes those results in a list based format, similar to this one: ([Cards Layout Example Codepen](https://codepen.io/jkinley/pen/wMYxRr)). The submission should have the following attributes:

- A search input field that filters on the results. The search can be based on any field you choose.
- The list should have images. While images are not included in API responses, please feel free to upload and use one image multiple times.
- Clicking on a list item should open a more detailed view of the item

## Notes

- Comment your code as much as possible, explaining why you've made the decisions you've made.
- Please be creative with your interface; we're looking for both technical expertise and eye for design!
- You should not need to leverage any third-party libraries; If you decide to use a third-party library, please explain the reasoning in a comment in your code. Feel free to use the Swapi JavaScript API.
- You do NOT have to write any tests.

## Criteria

Your work will be judged on:

- The structure and quality of your code.
- Your creativity in designing an interface.
- The ability for your code to achieve the functionality described above.

## Submission

Please fork this repository. You can provide your codebase in the form a github repo link to [spatel783@gmail.com](mailto:spatel783@gmail.com)
